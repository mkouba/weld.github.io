** for example, if you want to track down all extensions modifying `AnnotatedType` definitions, then link:/documentation/#7["enable the debug logging for Weld", window="_blank"] and look for messages containing `ProcessAnnotatedType.setAnnotatedType() called by ...`
* Conversations - allow to configure the default timeout and the concurrent access timeout (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2113[WELD-2113, window="_blank"])
* recover if a transaction is in progress but a JTA Synchronization callback cannot be registered (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2120[WELD-2120, window="_blank"])
* EJB proxies do not implement private methods anymore (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2119[WELD-2119, window="_blank"])
* interceptor instances used for @AroundConstruct are now reused for other types of interception (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2131[WELD-2131, window="_blank"])

** there are two new built-in interceptor bindings - `@ActivateRequestScope` and `@ActivateThreadScope` - to activate the http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/2.3.4.Final/en-US/html/environments.html#_request_context[request scope, window="_blank"] or the http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/2.3.4.Final/en-US/html/environments.html#_thread_context[thread scope, window="_blank"] within a business method invocation
** Weld builder allows to configure bean archive isolation, development mode and registration of shutdown hook manually (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2135[WELD-2135, window="_blank"])
