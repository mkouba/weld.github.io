The development of *Weld 3* (CDI 2) is underway.
However, we don't forget about the maintenance of the stable branch of Weld!
So I am very pleased to announce the first bugfix version of *Weld 2.4* (CDI 1.2).
See also https://issues.jboss.org/projects/WELD/versions/12331553[the release details, window="_blank"].
Thanks to everyone involved in this release!

Notable fixes and improvements:

* removed false positive warning about Jandex version used (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2231[WELD-2231, window="_blank"])
* fixed Groovy support - only filter out relevant methods from Groovy objects when generating bean proxies (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2255[WELD-2255, window="_blank"])
* optimized proxy class generation for "large classes" (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2244[WELD-2244, window="_blank"])
* improved the way Weld configuration info is logged (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2238[WELD-2238, window="_blank"])
* Weld SE
** added support for nested directories in uber jars, e.g. Spring Boot jar (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2254[WELD-2254, window="_blank"])
** allow to use `CDI.getBeanManager()` after `BeforeBeanDiscovery` is fired (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2256[WELD-2256, window="_blank"])
** don't abort container initialization if `JandexClassFileServices` is unable to load an annotation (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2232[WELD-2232, window="_blank"])
* Weld Servlet - document the usage of `org.jboss.weld.environment.container.class` init param (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2236[WELD-2236, window="_blank"])
