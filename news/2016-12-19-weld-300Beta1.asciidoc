:linkattrs:

I am very pleased to announce the first *Beta* version of Weld *3.0.0* (CDI 2.0).
See also https://issues.jboss.org/projects/WELD/versions/12331387[the release details, window="_blank"].
Thanks to everyone involved in this release!

This is an important milestone.
CDI 2.0 is now considered "feature complete" and so the next Weld 3 versions should be mostly dedicated to cleanup and optimization.
The next version will be Weld *3.0.0.CR1* (ETA in mid January).
Finally, we would like to release Weld *3.0.0.Final* in early February.

== New and noteworthy

* `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InterceptionFactory` implementation (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2257[WELD-2257, window="_blank"])
* `ProcessSyntheticObserverMethod` container lifecycle event (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2279[WELD-2279, window="_blank"])
* `BeforeDestroyed` event fired before a context is actually destroyed (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2269[WELD-2269, window="_blank"])
* "trimmed" bean archives (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2268[WELD-2268, window="_blank"])
* context control - `ActivateRequestContext` interceptor binding (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2267[WELD-2267, window="_blank"]) and `RequestContextController` built-in bean (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2266[WELD-2266, window="_blank"])
* `ProcessSyntheticBean` container lifecycle event (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2265[WELD-2265, window="_blank"])
* few proposals did not make it into CDI 2.0 and so we enhanced the Weld API:
** `org.jboss.weld.inject.WeldInstance` (already part of Weld 2.4 API)
** `org.jboss.weld.interceptor.WeldInvocationContext` allows to obtain a set of interceptor bindings for a lifecycle callback, business method, timeout method, or constructor (see also link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CDI-468[CDI-468, window="_blank"])
** `org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.event.WeldAfterBeanDiscovery` allows to obtain an `InterceptorConfigurator` to configure a new `Interceptor` bean
