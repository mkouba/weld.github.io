I am very pleased to announce the release of Weld *3.0.0.CR1* (aligned with *CDI 2.0-PFD*).
See also https://issues.jboss.org/projects/WELD/versions/12331714[the release details, window="_blank"].
Thanks to everyone involved in this release!
This version of Weld will be part of the JSR 365 Approval Ballot (watch http://cdi-spec.org/[CDI spec website, window="_blank"] for news).
The Beta1 version of Weld 3 turned out to be sufficiently stable and so the first release candidate is mostly dedicated to cleanup and minor optimizations.
We would like to release Weld *3.0.0.Final* (stable version of CDI 2.0) in early February.
