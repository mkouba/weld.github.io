I am very pleased to announce the release of Weld *3.0.0.CR2* (*CDI 2.0-PFD*).
The intention is to provide the latest updates so that early adopters and reviewers can work with up-to-date reference implementation during the JCP review process.

Notable fixes and improvements:

* `InterceptionFactory` handles interface correctly (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2335[WELD-2335, window="_blank"])
* Enable to obtain `InjectionPoint` metadata from within `BeanConfigurator#produceWith()` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2333[WELD-2333, window="_blank"])
* `ObserverMethodConfigurator.beanClass()` should be preset to the extension class (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2324[WELD-2324, window="_blank"])
* Performance improvements in `javax.enterprise.inject.Instance` implementation (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2322[WELD-2322, window="_blank"] and link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2323[WELD-2323, window="_blank"])
* Don't include built-in session and conversation scoped beans in the bean identifier index (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2343[WELD-2343, window="_blank"])
* Support `InjectionPoint` metadata injected into dependent singleton session bean (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2341[WELD-2341, window="_blank"])
* Logging
** Log DEBUG info about important phases during bootstrap (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2336[WELD-2336, window="_blank"])
** Fix the error message when an extension observer method is static (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2331[WELD-2331, window="_blank"])
** Improved transactional observer methods logging in case of failure (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2330[WELD-2330, window="_blank"])
* Weld SE - `ContainerInitialized` should be fired after the container is initialized and shutdown hook is registered (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2340[WELD-2340, window="_blank"])
* Probe development tool
** Extended bean archive info
** Monitor bean instance creation
** Do not mark a bean as unused if only injected into an observer method or disposer method
** `org.jboss.weld.probe` package is vetoed
