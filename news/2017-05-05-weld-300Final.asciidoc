I am very pleased to announce the release of Weld *3.0.0.Final* - the first implementation of *CDI 2.0*!
I would like to thank not only to everyone involved in this particular release but also to the Weld community as a whole and also to all active CDI EG members who invested a lot of energy into the specification process!

NOTE: Weld 3 is an IMPORTANT MILESTONE.
Therefore, we're preparing a special blogpost summarizing all the important stuff that was added.
Expect the *Tour around Weld 3* blogpost within a few days.

Let's sum up the notable fixes and improvements since *3.0.0.CR2*:

* Weld defines two non-portable *notification options* to configure the notification of asynchronous observer methods (see also link:http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/3.0.0.Final/en-US/html/events.html#_notification_options[Notification options, window="_blank"] for more info):
** `weld.async.notification.mode` - the notification mode, possible values are: `SERIAL` (default) and `PARALLEL`
** `weld.async.notification.timeout` - the notification timeout (in milliseconds) after which the returned completion stage must be completed.
*** If the time expires the stage is completed exceptionally with a `CompletionException` holding the `java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException` as its cause
*** The expiration does not abort the notification of the observers
* Session replication - handle situation when `HTTPSessionBean` might not be serializable (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2346[WELD-2346, window="_blank"])
* Fire `@Initialied(RequestScoped.class)`/`@Destroyed(RequestScoped.class)` events for a `@PostConstruct` callback if the request context was activated for the specific callback
* Weld SE
** It's possible to easily register a `org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Service` during container bootstrap (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2360[WELD-2360, window="_blank"])
** Any `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.CDI` method can now be called during `AfterDeploymentValidation` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2371[WELD-2371, window="_blank"])
** `ContainerInitialized` and `ContainerShutdown` now implement `toString()` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2354[WELD-2354, window="_blank"])
* Weld Servlet
** Fixed usage of Jandex on Tomcat when using `unpackWars=false` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2357[WELD-2357, window="_blank"])
* Added option to disable Jandex in Weld SE and Weld Servlet (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2374[WELD-2374, window="_blank"])
* Development tools
** If a deployment validation fails and the development mode is enabled a simple *validation HTML report* (which contains a lot of useful information) is generated
*** Users are encouraged to always attach this report when asking a question on the mailing list or any other communication channel
* Updated documentation and migration notes for integrators
* Examples cleanup (dropped GAE support, etc.)
